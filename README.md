## 📌 What Is DeepTest?

DeepTest is an advanced performance‑analysis indicator that calculates a wide range of statistical metrics, offering **in‑depth evaluation of strategy performance** inside TradingView.

- How different market regimes affect performance  

This makes it invaluable for:

- Portfolio managers
